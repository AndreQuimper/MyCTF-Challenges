WolvCTF 2025 was the CTF organized by WolvSec, a information security team at the University of Michigan.
I was the president of the club that year so I helped as an organizer and a challenge author. Overall I think the CTF went really well.  
I also think some of the challenges I wrote were pretty interesting, Particularly `Vinyl`, `VC1K` and `LabGrown`.  

Here are some stats for the CTF:
- 1,392 users registered
- 742 teams registered
- 5523 IP Addresses
- 50 challenges
- 85% of survey respondents gave the CTF a rating of 7/10 or higher
