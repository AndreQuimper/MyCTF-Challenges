WolvCTF 2024 was the CTF organized by WolvSec, a information security team at the University of Michigan.  
I helped as an organizer and a challenge author and I'm really glad on how the CTF went.  
Here are some stats for the CTF:  
- 1,802 users registered 
- 1,030 teams registered 
- 560 teams with non-trivial scores (2 or more solves)
- 61 challenges
- 70% of survey respondents gave the CTF a rating of 8/10 or higher
